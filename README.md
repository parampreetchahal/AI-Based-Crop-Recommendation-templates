# AI-Based-Crop-Recommendation-templates
Here's a sample `README.md` file for your crop recommendation system:

---


## Overview

This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** designed to help farmers and agriculturists identify the most suitable crop for their land based on various environmental and soil parameters. By inputting key details like **Nitrogen**, **Phosphorus**, **Potassium** levels, along with **Temperature**, **Humidity**, **pH**, and **Rainfall**, this system predicts the most suitable crop using a trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: A web-based form to input soil and environmental data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts the optimal crop based on soil and weather conditions using the `cropapp.pkl` model.
- **Efficient Prediction**: The system provides quick and accurate crop recommendations, improving agricultural decision-making.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Joblib (for loading the trained model)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/crop-recommendation-system.git
   cd crop-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download or Train the Model**:
   Ensure that the machine learning model (`cropapp.pkl`) is in the root directory. If you don't have the model, you can train your own using the provided dataset.

4. **Run the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web Application**:
   Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Nitrogen (N)
   - Phosphorus (P)
   - Potassium (K)
   - Temperature (in Celsius)
   - Humidity (in %)
   - pH (soil pH level)
   - Rainfall (in mm)

2. **Get Prediction**:
   - After submitting the form, the system will return the **recommended crop** based on the input parameters.

## Model Details

- The system uses a machine learning model trained on agricultural data to predict the optimal crop for given environmental conditions.
- The model was built using the **Random Forest Classifier**, but other algorithms like SVM, KNN, or Decision Trees could also be used based on experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model includes soil and environmental features along with crop labels. This dataset can be extended or improved for better prediction accuracy.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile App Integration**: Making the system accessible on mobile devices for wider reach.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Use real-time weather data to enhance the prediction accuracy.
- **Recommendation for Fertilizers**: Adding an option to recommend fertilizers based on soil deficiencies.
